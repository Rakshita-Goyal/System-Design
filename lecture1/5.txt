Tier archiectecture:
Logical sepration between diffenet components of application like frontend backend db 

authentication(who are you) and authorization(what yu can do)

simple authetication :
client registers app gives the username and password to it also stored in db 
everytime the client comes it gives username and password and app checks it from the db and gives response 

token based:
client registers get username password,then user sends the username and passsword server verifies it ans sends token ,now
client can send token and get response in return savinf the db calls

oauth :
signup without password

Proxy:
a proxy server is a hardware or piece of software that is placed between the client and a application to provide 
intermediary services in the communication 
Proxy server:provides gateway between the user and internet
types:
forward proxy: hides the identity of client , so client request goes to proxy server and it hits the actual server and reponse also in same way
reverse proxy:hides the server , makes user feel there is only one server ,provides load balancing for server ,filter somes requests,bswap backend servers without traffic diturbance
