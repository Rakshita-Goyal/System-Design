file storage system is a dbms where data is stored in form of files 
data redundancy:update,delete anamoly leading to data inconsisitency
poor security
slow: retrival difficult

RDBMS:
software that performs data operations on relational database like store ,manage ,query and retrieve
data is stored in tables ,relation between two tables through foreign keys 
advantages:no redundancy and inconsistency ,data concurrency(prevent abnormalities from occuring)
better retrieval,data integrity(contraints)
disadvantages:rigid schema,high cost,scaling issue(shrading/horizontal difficult) thats why scaling issue

NOSQL:
NON relational database
key-value:for caching generally eg:redis
document :combines dbms and nosql, relation concept from rdbms, dynamic schema and horizontal scaling from nosql databases eg:mongodb
columnar :columns are stored together instead of rows, so that aggregation in such databases is rapid for data analysis eg:casandra
graph: represents and stores entities and relationships in form of graph eg social networks google maps

Normalization(breaking in tables and reduce redundancy) and Denormalization(merging of tables ):
Denormalization advantages: better read ,management convienence ,high availability,reduce number of netwrok calls
disadvantages:waste of memory,more complexity,data inconsistency ,slow write due to redundancy 

polugot persistence:multiple dbs used
in e-commerce application 
shopping cart and session data->key values
completed order:document store
inventory and price:rdbms
customer social graphs:graph store 

Indexing :
creates lookup table with a column and pointer to the memory location of the row containing this coloumn 
o(logn) to search ,btrees used for indexing 
for read intensive only
