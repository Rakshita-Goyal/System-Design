Communication

Sysnchronous communication(blocking call)
request client wait for response     sequential way
for consistency ,transaction , real time response

Asynchronous communication (non blocking)
computation takes a lot of time,scalability of application,avoid cascading failures (dont let server to overwhelm)

Message based communication:
client send in form of message ,resieves response in form of message
it is async ,so client does not halt the process and wait for the process 
producer:client
consumer:server
agent:channel between 
P2P (email like) fifo queue me push asynchronous 
Publish subscribe model(news email)
tools:kafka rabbitmq

web server : tools or programs that help keep the web application always up and running 
can be h/w,s/w or both 
HTTP servers

Communication protocols
protocols immplemented using hardware ,software and combination of both :
push:server pushes new events to the client ,reduces the server load 
pull/polling :client requests,server responds. but 100 requests but get response to just 5 requests
long polling :client requets,server keep it open until it gives response ,server always busy,sequence can be disturbed
socket:continous frequent channel,it is a 2-way connection link between two servers/nodes over the network 
server sent events :one way, can push only when the site is open ,long lived connection
