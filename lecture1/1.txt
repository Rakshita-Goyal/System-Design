system design is process of designing the elements of system like 
architecture,modules,components,
different interfaces of those components and 
the data that flows into the system 

HLD:high level design 
describes the main components developed for resulting product
archietectural details,database design ,services,processes,relationships between modules and features 

LLD:low level design 
describes the design of each element in hld system 
claases,interfaces,relationaship between claases,logic ,design schema,design pattern 

Monolithic archietecture:all components and functionalities in single codebase,less complex,easy ,high productive 
centralised system 
feww network callls,easy to secure ,easy integration test,lantency low
if error in a module,whole system destroyed
if one module updated, whole deployed
tightly coupled,difficult to chnge language ,single point of failure 

Distributed system/ microservice :collection of indivisual systems connected via network that shares the resources ,communicates 
seprate repos and deployed separately
data loss can happen but replication is solution 
scalable ,avoid bottleneck
complex,load balancer requires,difficult to secure 

Latency:request+response time(network delay)+computational delay
monolithic:only computational delay (process to process calls only)
distributed:more latency-: n/w +computational delay
reduce by 
cachching ,cdn ,upgrade h/w 

Througput :
volume of work flowing through a system 
distributed:more throughput,more machines added
causes of low throuhput: high latency,protocol overhead, congestion 
improve by: cdn,caching ,distributed system ,load balancer,upgrade h/w

Availability:
distributed :more avalaible beacuse not all server down ,replicas also present 
in monolithic also replicas of whole system (but single module fail others also fail)
more fault tolerant then more availaible 
improve by: replication ,distributed system ,redundancy(in microservice),replication (in databases as the nodes are synchronized)

Consistency:for all same requestes the clients should get same response 
recent update committed to all systems , no dirty read 
monolithic is always consisttent
improve :improve metwork bandwidth,stop the read operation ,replication based on distance aware strategies(servers/replicas ko paas paas )
types of consistencies:
Strong consistency: system dos not allow read operation until all replicated nodes are updated 
Eventual consistency: read requestes are not halted,some read old data but eventually all the datas updated to latest data 
Weak consistency : not neccesary that all nodes are updated 

CAP theorem:
Consistency,Availability,Partition Tolerance 
only 2 properties can be attained 
CA:wait for update on all servers so unavalaible like bank
AP:cant be consistent if always availaible if any update 
CA:centralized monolithic(same get updated ) but if one fail no ther partition/replica availaible
