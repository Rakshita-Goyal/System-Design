Lomport Logical clock 
every event counnter++ and when receiving max+1 of previous and sender's

Vertical scaling 
increase the ram,cpu
easy ,less power, easy management
single point of failure,limited scope, best quality since 1 machine only,so price high
Horizontal scaling 
increase the servers 
no single failunre,price less
power more,secirity more required

Redundancy:
duplication of nodes or components so that when a node or component falis ,duplicate serves the customer
Active redundancy: when each unit is operating/active and responding to action.Multiple nodes are connected to load balancer and each receive equal load
Passive redundancy: when one node is active and other is not operating .during breakdown of active active node, the passive node maintain availability by becoming active 

Replication :redundancy+synchronization
Active replication: all the nodes are active and performing read and write 
Passive replication:evry read write by the master,if master go down ,slave becomes the master 
master-slave replication can be either synchronous or asynchronous, if the changes in master and slave same time then synchronous
if changes are queued and written later then asynchronous

Load Balancer:
process of efficient distribution of network traffic across all nodes in a distributed system 
roles of load balancer:
load distribution is equal over every node 
health check: if node is operational or not,request passed to another 
high scalability,availability and throughput ,help resource utilisation,less response time ,allow high traffic ,prevent downtime 

in monolithich horizontal scaling can happen by increasig the instaces of machine but 
vertical scaling preferrred so load balancer not needed as such 

single point of failure of load balancer : for that one passive load balancer also present 

Load balancing algorithms:
Round Robin. :rotation fashion 
Weighted Round Robin(static):round robin but servers have different capacities,so some servers has more resorces ,some have more 
IP Hash algorithm (static):almost same capacity ,has a hash function(in sorce ip),for random and unbiased server to request to 
Source IP Hash(static):combines the server and client's source and destination ip address to produce hash key 
Least Connection (dynamic):direct to server which has least active requests 
Least Response Time (dynamic):directed to server with least response time 

Caching :uses primary memory thats why fast ,onced pulled from the database,next tme from cache 
types of cache :
In memory/local:locally stored in server
Distributed/external :all nodes sahres a cache , eg redis memchached
cache :more for read extensive ,static 
application server cache (database,apis etc)
cdn from global to local 

Cache Eviction Strategies: space is limited so needed to be deleted 
ttl(time to live)
Strategies :
LRU(least recentally used)
MRU(most recentally used)
LFU(Least frequently used)
LIFO(Last in first out)
FIFO(first in first out)
RR(round robin)
