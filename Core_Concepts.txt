System Design = deciding how to build a large software system

high level design      low level design 
hld:overview of sysytem :  services,databases,cachingload balancers,message queues
lld:classes,objects,methods,db schema,design patterns,design apis,models

eg:
functional :user signup login ,users can buy subscription,play pause video
and non functional requirements : secure,scalable,low latency

hld:
serverless and serverful
horizontal and vertical scaling 
threads
pages
request response cycle
dns

Databases
sql and no sql
in-memory databases
data replication and migration 
data partitioning
sharding 

consistency and availability 
data consistency and its levels
isolation and its levels
cap theorem 

cache
redis,memchached
write policies:write bck write through and around
replacement policies
cnn content delivery networks

networking :
tcp/udp
http(1/2/3) https
web sockets
webRTC and video streaming 

load balancers
load balancing algos(stateless and stateful)
consistent hashing 
proxy and reverse proxy
rate limiting 

message queues
asynchronous processing (kafka ,rabbitmq)
publisher-subscriber model

monolithic and microservice
why 
single point of failure
avoiding cascading failures
containerization 
migrating to microservices

monitoring and logging 
logging evevnts and monitoring metrics
anamoly detection 

security :
token for auth
sso oauth
access control list rule engines
encryption 

system design tradeoffs:
push and pull archietecture
consitency and availability
sql and nosql
memory and latency 
throughput and latency
accuracy and latency

egs:major apps like uber whattapp netflix 


LLD

oops:
4 pillars
solid principles

design patterns:
creational(singleton,factory etc)
structural(proxy,bridge etc )
behaviuoral(strategy,command,observer etc )

concurrency and thread safety
thread safe injection 
locking mecjanism
producer-consumer
race condition synchronization 

uml diagrams

apis :
api design 
req/res object modelling
versioning and extensibility
clean code principles :dry,srp etc 
avoiding god classes

eg:tic tac ,plitwise,noification system ,food delivery etc
