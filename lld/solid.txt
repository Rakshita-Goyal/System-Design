write clean and easy to understand code to get consistent system 
problems we face:mantainability,readability,debugging time  
SOLID:
single responsibility principle(SRP)
open close principle(OCP)
liskov substitution principle (LSP)
interface segregtion principle(ISP)
dependency injection principle(DIP)

SRP:a class should have only one reason to change Or/ does only 1 thing 
     for any updation ,less classes to change 

OCP:     a class should be open for extension but closed for modification 

LSP: subclasses should be sustituable for other base classes.If S is a subtype of T, then T should work correctly with S.
      (dont change the clients request as it will tightly couple the client to claases, client should only interact with the interface )
      (is breaks the ocp otherwise ) so just create a narrower parent class
Three categories of LSP rules:
Signature rules:(method argument rule)same or broader argument
               (Return Type Rule:)same or narrower return type
               (Exception rule):same or narrower
Property Rules:Class invarient: means the basic logic shouldnot be broken by the child 
               History contraints :should address and ahve the parent methods 
Method Rules:Preconditions(the child class should include parent and can also include other values as well)
             Postconditions(the child can have extra functions as well but has to have the parents and cant contradict the parents function )

ISP:     Many client specific interfaces are better than one generic interface ,client shouldnt be forced to implement the methods is doesnt need

DIP:     high level module should nt depend on low level module,rather both should depend on the abstraction
