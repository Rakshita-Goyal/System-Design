Inheritance :  (closed but uncloured arrow)
 Association :simple line (open arrow)
 Realization:closed uncloured arrow
 Dependency:dotted open arrow
 Aggregation :uncloured diamond 
 Composition: coloured diamond 

UML unified modelling language 
standarized visual language to craete bluprints, diagrams,and models of software systems
types of uml diagrams:
Structural and behaviourial diagram 
Structural: components that make up the systems and relationship between them (static modelling)
behaviourial: represent what is interaction between the components of a systems and with other systems and what happens in the system 
              (dynamic modelling )
14 uml diagrams (7-7)
for lld these two to be studied:
Structural-Class diagram 
Behaviourial -Sequence diagram 

Class diagram : classes (attritubets,operations,relationships)in the application and how they are connected to each other 
Car
+brand:String 
#model:String
-startEngine():void 
-stopEngine():void
+ for public
- for private
# for protected 

if abstract class write <<abstract>> above the box 

Associations :dependency between the classes on each other 
 Types:
 Class associations and Object Associations
 Class Associations: inheritance ,
 Object Associations:simple association,Aggregation,Composition 
 Inheritance : is a relationship -> (closed but uncloured arrow) supercar is a car (arrow from supercar to car)

Composition: Has a ralationship
simple association: arjun has a house (open arrow froom arjun to house )
Aggregation:uncolured diamond room has a bed sofa chair ,(room is a container in which these exist)these also exist independently 
Composition: coloured diamond ,chair has wheels arms seat (cant exist independently )

to represent has a relationship 
get a refernce of class Wheel wh in class chair and initize in the constructor
so we will call ch->wh->method 

Sequence diagram:interaction between objects and flow 
class are represented just the block 
lifeline :when the object starts in the application 
activation bar :actually th object got active (can actually give and receive message from other object)
message:two types:
 synchronous: wait for response then you can send message
   message as closed arrow and response as dotted arrow closed triangle coloured .message above line<<message>>
 asynchronous: can continously send the messages
   simple line with open arrow.<<message>>above 
create message of a object (lifeline of object creadted)and destroy message->lifeline to the existing object ends 
lost message :meassge send and lost ,denoted as circle with dot inside 
found message :from unknown sorce(circle with a dot ) it comes to the object activation bas 

firstly create flow then objects identify then squence diagram 
alt represents if else in the diagram 
option: if condition only
loop: for iteration

Structural diagrams :
Class diagram :show static structure of system(for ood),claases,attributes,relationships
Component diagram: how omponents combine to create larger components 
Composite Structure diagram :represents the internal structure of the class and its interaction points with other parts of system 
Deployment diagram: models the physical deployment of the componets,focus on real entities like servers and coputing resources 
Object diagram:represents snapshot of a syatem at a particular point ,showing relationships between objects 
Package diagram:heirarchial groupings of elements that allow for managable organization of various components of a system 
Profile diagram:enables extension of a uml model by means of streotypes 

Behaviourial daigrams:
Activity diagram :shows squence of processes(workfloes)
Communication diagram /collaboation diagram :focuses on objects and their relationships, showing sequenced meaasegs exchanged between objects 
Sequence diagram :captures the ordered sequence of the messages sent between objects ,several objects interaction within single use case
State Machine diagrams: descibes the behaviour of system in terms of states and transitions controlled by eternal inputs 
Timing diagram: represents the behaviour of objects in given time frame and intercation during that time frame 
Interaction overview :shows sequence of interaction diagrams and order they happen ,like activity but focus on interaction
