machine programming ->assembly lvel-> procedural programming ->oops (object oriented programming )
oops:
real world modelling 
data security
scable and resuable 

Objects which interacts 
object had characteristics and behaviour
class is blueprint to make the objects 

How objects communicate :

class Car{
    string brand;
    void start();
}
class owner{
    Car car ;
    string name;
    voidd drive(){
        car.start();
    }
}

Pillars of oops:
Abstraction: hides the unneccasary details from the client and show only what is necassary
Encapsulation: combines characters and behaviours together in a capsule ,data security 
access modifier:public private protected  (getter setter)
Inheritance: extends from the parent to child 
 class child:public parent ,means the parent class ke public ,protected are treated as them selves and private cant be 
 class child:protected parent ,means public and protected will be considered as protected
 class child:private parent ,means public ,protected of the parent are treated as private from that class 

Polymorphism:dynamic(method overriding ) and static(method oveloading ,operator overloading)
