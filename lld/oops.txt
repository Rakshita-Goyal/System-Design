machine programming ->assembly lvel-> procedural programming ->oops (object oriented programming )
oops:
real world modelling 
data security
scable and resuable 

Objects which interacts 
object had characteristics and behaviour
class is blueprint to make the objects 

How objects communicate :

class Car{
    string brand;
    void start();
}
class owner{
    Car car ;
    string name;
    voidd drive(){
        car.start();
    }
}

Pillars of oops:
Abstraction: hides the unneccasary details from the client and show only what is necassary
Encapsulation: 
Inheritance
Polymorphism
