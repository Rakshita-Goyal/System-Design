//Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state,
//subject (which changes )and observers (which gets notified)
// all its dependents are notified automatically.
//YouTube subscribers → channel uploads video
//Stock price updates → investors notified
//Weather station → display devices
//Event listeners in UI

//bad method: polling (observer asks if something present)
//good: pushing 

//concrete class has a relation with comcrete class
